    eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteStop basically works in the same way as eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteStart. The only difference is that this request is sent in order to initiate the stopping of a charging process. The request `MUST` contain the SessionID that was created by Hubject after the initial eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteStart request.
