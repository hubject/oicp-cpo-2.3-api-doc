    eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteReservationStop basically works in the same way as eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteReservationStart.
    The only difference is that this request is sent in order to end the reservation of a charging spot.
    The request `MUST` contain the SessionID that was created by Hubject after the initial eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteReservationStart request.
    After the eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteReservationStop the CPO `MUST` provide a CDR.
