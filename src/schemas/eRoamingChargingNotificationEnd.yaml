  A customer of an EMP has fully charged a vehicle at a charging station of a CPO. The charging process was started with an eRoamingAuthorizeStart or an eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteStart operation. The energy flow has ended, but the process has not yet been stopped and the vehicle is blocking the charging station.

  The CPO’s backend system MAY send a ChargingNotification of type “End” after the CPO considers the charging of an EV concluded (because no energy is transmitted anymore) in order to inform the EMP that the actual charging (the energy flow) of the vehicle has stopped. The charging process has not yet been stopped by the customer and the session is still active.

  The ChargingNotification of type “End” is a message that contains information about the charging end of a session (e.g. ConsumedEnergy, ChargingEnd).
