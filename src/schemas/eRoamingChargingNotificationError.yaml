  A customer of EMP Authorizes the charging session at particular charging station (via any means for eg REFID card, Mobile etc). Due to some errors sometime, it is possible that charging does not start or charging process is abruptly stopped or fluctuations in the charging process. It is really important for Customer as well as EMP to know what exactly is happening at the charging process. This notification eventually helps EMPs well informed about the problem occurred with the charging process. This information can be easily passed onto Customer so that he/she can take appropriate action.

  The CPO’s backend system MAY send a ChargingNotification of type “Error” after the CPO gets an information about the error at the charging station. The CPO can transmit one of the ErrorClass defined by Hubject along with the additional information which elaborated the Error. The customer has to take one of the three action EV needs to be charged at some different station, Cables is properly attached or the error is for information only no action required by customer.

  The ChargingNotification of type “Error” is a message that contains information about the charging end of a session (e.g. ErrorClass, ErrorAdditionalInfo).
