  A customer of EMP Authorizes the charging session at particular charging station (via any means for eg REFID card, Mobile etc). The charging session is authorized by Hubject / CPO system. The authorization of charging process and plugging the cable in EV does not guarantee that energy flow into the Vehicle is initiated. It is really important for for EMP and its end consumer to know if the charging has started.

  The CPO’s backend system MAY send a ChargingNotification of type “Start” after the CPO considers the charging of an EV is started (since energy flow have started) in order to inform the EMP that the actual charging (the energy flow) of the vehicle has started.

  The ChargingNotification of type “Start” is a message that contains information about the charging start of a session (e.g. ChargingStart).
